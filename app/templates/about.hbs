  <h1 class="header-xlarge">Welcome to NYC&nbsp;Street&nbsp;Map</h1>

  <p class="lead">NYC Street Map is an ongoing effort to digitize official street records, bring them together with other street information, and make them easily accessible to the public. With this app, you can find the official mapped width, name, and status of specific streets and how they may relate to specific properties. You can also see how the street grid has changed over time in your area.</p>

  <p>NYC Street Map combines 8000+ components of the official City Map with other street information into a seamless Citywide map. However, NYC Street Map does not contain all the information on the City Map and may have inaccuracies. The information shown on NYC Street Map must be confirmed based on the official City Map records.</p>
