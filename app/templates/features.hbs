  <p>NYC Street Map does not yet include all the information contained on the City Map. As more information becomes electronically available, NYC Street Map will be updated. This app currently provides the following information:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Boundaries of mapped and unmapped streets</li>
    <li>Official names of streets</li>
    <li>Mapped street widths (usually includes sidewalks)</li>
    <li>Alteration maps showing approved changes to the City Map since 1938 (In some areas, maps are available that show changes which have been approved by the City Planning Commission and City Council, but have not yet taken effect.)</li>
    <li>Street and place names established by local law</li>
  </ul>
